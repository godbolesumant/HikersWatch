## HikersWatch application location (APK file)
- https://github.com/godbolesumant/WhatsTheWeather/blob/master/app/release/app-release.apk
NOTE: The altidude is 0 in all the screenshots because the screenshots were taken from emulator. But I have checked it on real device and it works perfectly fine.

## Description
Application will display the Latitude, Longitude, Altitude, Accuracy and Address of the device.
This will help the hiker to determine where he is currently. 
App is particularly helpful for quick information of your current location.
In suitations of crisis example, where mobile touch is damaged but display is working and you just want to know the location, then you can use this app. Just link the app to a hard press button and you have an app thaat will save u in crisis :)
